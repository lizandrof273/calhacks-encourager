## Notes

We built this application at cal hacks. This application was fun to build becuase we wanted to create something that could take stress out of the day. Together as a team we discussed several differnet types of uplifiting qoutes we could have in the application and decided to go with a simple design for the user to quickly be encourged and continue to work on themsleves. We beleive mental health is extremely important and hope to help anyone who is having a rough day.
